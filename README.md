## Hello, I'm Owen (he/him) :wave:

### About Me 

I'm currently a student at the University of Virginia majoring in BS Computer Science and minoring in Business Engineering.
I have been a teachers assistant for database, software development essentials and programming languages for web development.
Through my experience at UVA, I have been a part of two research projects, one focusing on data parallelism and deep learning, then the other 
focusing on cloud application for medical purposes. Also, I was a DevOps intern for nCino.

Currently I am starting two new projects. The first is a Climate Activist Website that users can use 
to inform thenselves about climate issues and ways to help. The second project is a music recommendation
system using machine learning.

I am also working toward my DevOps Engineering AWS certificate. I enjoy extending myself and learning. I am
always looking to connect and meet people!
