## Hello, I'm Owen :wave:

### About Me 

I'm currently a student at the University of Virginia majoring in BS Computer Science and minoring in Business Engineering.
I have been a teachers assistant for database, software development essentials and programming languages for web development.
Through my experience at UVA, I have been a part of two research projects, one focusing on data parallelism and deep learning, then the other 
focusing on cloud application for medical purposes. Also, I was a DevOps intern for nCino.
